## when something is added to git then it says A next to the file

- Git was invented by Linus Torvalds

## name of default branch
- used to be `master`
- now we use `main`

## flow
1. create/clone
- git init/git clone
2. add files that we want to track
- git add [filename]
3. commit changes
-git commit -m "meaningful message"
4. to check changes
-git status
5. to check differences between git commits
- git diff

### alternatives
- git checkout -b new_branch (git branch)
    - git branch new_branch
- git checkout new_branch OR git switch new_branch

- use branches to collaborate on projects 

git branch  -M main
mv move or rename
